## Np complete problems

- Decision vs Optimizations
  - Decision problem : Yes/No
  - Optimization problem : Max/Min
- P/NP problems
  - P problem: Decision problems that is **solvable** in polynomial time
  - NP: Decision problems that is **verifiable** in polynomial time
- NP hard
- NP complete

## Prove NP complete

- Prove that problem $x\in NP$
  - Certificate and verifier
- Choose a known problem $Y$ in NP complete
- Prove $y \leq _p x$
  - Stratigies on slides

- Known NPC
  - 3-SAT
  - Inde set
  - Vertex cover
  - Set cover
  - Set packing
